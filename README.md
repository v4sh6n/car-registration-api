Register cars with their brand, model, and license plate.
Retrieve a list of registered cars in the system.
The main goal of this project is to serve as a foundation for understanding fundamental backend development concepts with Spring Boot, including creating models, controllers, and repositories, as well as exposing RESTful endpoints.

Java 17: The main programming language.
Spring Boot: A framework for Java application development.
H2 Database: An in-memory database for simplicity and testing.
Maven: A build and dependency management tool.
Git: Version control system.
